# Data for project in FISH 546



The data I will be using for this project was given to me by Mackenzie Gavery on 2016-10-06 via a flash drive.



## Sample description and preparation



The sperm sample was collected at the Wells Dam Hatchery on 2014-04-29 from a returning adult male raised at the Wells Dam Hatchery for one year in freshwater before release (identified based on both an elastomer and a coded-wire tag, as well as the absence of an adipose fin). A library was prepared for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) from the sperm sample by Mackenzie according to her protocol and the library was run on the MiSeq at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.



## Data description



Although the original data included paired end reads, I will only be working with single end reads (R1) due to the fact that Mackenzie found the R2 reads to be low quality. Each fragment is 100-300bp, therefore, since each read is 150bp long I should have very little adapter contamination.
