#Notebook structure for FISH 546 Project

In the future, I will mostly be working on Mac OS when I do this type of work, therefore, I have chosen to perform the analyses for this project on a Mac Desktop (OS Version 10.11.6) rather than the Windows (OS Version 8.1) I use in class. So, going forward, rather than using a Jupyter Notebook to record analyses I perform (since I do not currently have this capability on the Mac Desktop) I will be recording what I do with Markdown files, embedding code used within them, and committing these to GitHub. See `Software_documentation_on_Mac` in `analyses/` for versions of software used and how they were downloaded to the Mac Desktop.
