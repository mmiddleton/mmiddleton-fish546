# Data for project in FISH 546

The data I will be using for this project was given to me by Mackenzie Gavery on 2016-10-06 via a flash drive.

## Project description

After discussing with Mackenzie what data I might want to work with we decided that it might be more ideal to look at a smaller amount of data that I could play around with more effectively while learning these techniques. Therefore, the project that I will be working on will examine the methylome of a single individual rather than looking at differences in methylation between steelhead raised in a hatchery or wild environment.

## Sample description and preparation

The sperm sample was collected at the Wells Dam Hatchery on 2014-04-29 from a returning adult male raised at the Wells Dam Hatchery for one year in freshwater before release (identified based on both an elastomer and a coded-wire tag, as well as the absence of an adipose fin). A library was prepared for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) from the sperm sample by Mackenzie according to her protocol and the library was run on the MiSeq at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

## Data description

Although the original data included paired end reads, I will only be working with single end reads (R1) due to the fact that Mackenzie found the R2 reads to be low quality. Each fragment is 100-300bp, therefore, since each read is 100bp long I should have very little adapter contamination.
