Command line parameters for 89_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq (fastqc results ending in trimmed_fastqc_4):


trim_galore --rrbs --fastqc 89_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq

--Talked to Mac and that was all that she ran when she used TrimGalore for this data.
Looks exactly the same as the last run that I did which makes sense because the default quality (-q) is 20 unless
you add the -q command and specify something different, so I have basically been specifying that the program do what it 
would have done anyway... Oh well.
